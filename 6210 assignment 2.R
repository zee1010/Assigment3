###In this project we used two different machine learning techniques in a supervised machine learning approach to separate Cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) and Cytochrome b (cytb) sequences within the family Muridae.The objective was to investigate whether one classifier outperforms the other when differentiating the two genes. The Muridae family was chosen so sufficient IDs can be obtained for our classification, they are the largest family of rodents and mammals and they also contain one of the most studied genus Mus(Aghov? et al., 2018). COI and cytB are protein coding genes, encoded by the mitochondria, in the past they have been used for phylogenetic analysis at various taxonomic levels as well as successfully estimating divergence(Kartavtsev, 2011). However, because they are both protein coding and encoded by the mitochondria they are likely to have similar sequences. Therefore, It is interesting to explore whether their sequences have sufficient variability within the Muridae family to be considered distinct. The two classifiers used in our project are Random Forest and Naive Bayes classifier. The Random forest classifier uses an ensemble algorithm, which was first introduced Breiman (Latief et al.,2019). It creates multiple decision trees through regression models and each tree predicts an outcome, the one with the most "votes" is used for classification (Yiu, 2021; Latief et al.,2019). Some advantages of the random forest classifier include: efficiency, only few parameters are needed in comparison to other models, and it is not sensitive to over fitting (Latief et al.,2019). The Naive Bayes is based on Bayes theorem and uses a probabilistic prediction approach to create a model (Latief et al.,2019).The term Naive is reflects that the predictors used are independent of each other(Gandhi, 2018). Some advantages of the Naive Bayes model include accuracy and speed.

####Data Acquisition

#Look for searchable fields in nuccore database to determine which ones will be used for analysis
entrez_db_searchable(db = "nuccore")

#Create function to fetch fasta files required for analysis from Entrez_fuction script used in class
FetchFastaFiles <- function(searchTerm, seqsPerFile = 100, fastaFileName) {
  
# This function will fetch FASTA files from NCBI nuccore based on a provided search term.
# searchTerm = character vector containing Entrez search term
# seqsPerFile = number of sequences to write to each FASTA file
# fastaFileName = character vector containing name you want to give to the FASTA files you are fetching
  
# Initial search for finding maximum number of hits
search1 <- entrez_search(db = "nuccore", term = searchTerm)
# Second search for obtaining max number of hits and their IDs
search2 <- entrez_search(db = "nuccore", term = searchTerm, retmax = search1$count, use_history = T)
  
# Fetch the sequences in FASTA format using the web_history object.
for (start_rec in seq(0, search2$retmax, seqsPerFile)) {
    fname <- paste(fastaFileName, start_rec, ".fasta", sep = "")
    recs <- entrez_fetch(db = "nuccore", web_history = search2$web_history, rettype = "fasta", retstart = start_rec, retmax = seqsPerFile)
    write(recs, fname)
    print(paste("Wrote records to ", fname, sep = ""))
  }
  
return(search2)
  
}

##Using the  function to fetch fasta files
#Searching for Muridae (common and scientific names using ORGN] and gene CytB in nuccore database (nucleotide database). The length of cytB gene sequence length is restricted to 600-1000bp to prevent whole mitochondrial genomes from being incorporated. Each fasta file will contain 1000 sequences

#Searching for Muridae (common and scientific names using ORGN] and gene COI in nuccore database (nucleotide database). The length of COI gene sequence length is restricted to 600-700bp to prevent whole mitochondrial genomes from being incorporated. Each fasta file will contain 1000 sequences
Muridae_COI<-FetchFastaFiles("Muridae[ORGN] AND COI[Gene] AND 400:700[SLEN]", 1000, "Muridae_COI")

###Creating a function merge the all the fasta files together using Entrez_fuction script used in class ito one dataframe
MergeFastaFiles <- function(filePattern) {
  
# This function merges multiple FASTA files into one dataframe.
  
# filePattern = Character vector containing common pattern in FASTA file names
  
# Read the FASTA files in.

# Convert them into dataframes.
l_dfFastaFiles <- lapply(l_fastaFiles, function(x) data.frame(Title = names(x), Sequence = paste(x) ))
  
# Combine the list of dataframes into one dataframe.
Muridae_COIs <- do.call("rbind", l_dfFastaFiles)
  
return(Muridae_COIs)
  
}

#Creating dataframes 
Muridae_COI<-MergeFastaFiles("Muridae_COI*")
Muridae_cytB<-MergeFastaFiles("Muridae_cytB*")

#cleaning up species names so they are more easily readable using stringr package and the function word(). This constricts the title to only species name, which are specified by 2L and 3L and a new column called species name is created
Muridae_COI$Species_name <- word(Muridae_COI$Title, 2L, 3L)

#Rearranging columns so species name comes after title, followed by sequence
Muridae_COI <- Muridae_COI[, c("Title", "Species_name", "Sequence")]

#Same for cytB sequences
Muridae_cytB$Species_name <- word(Muridae_cytB$Title, 2L, 3L)

###Results and Discussion:
#Our study was intended to investigate whether Random Forest or Naive Bayes classifier would be better at predicting COI and cytB within the Muridae family. We predicted that Random forest would be able to classify COI and cytB genes far more efficiently and accurately based on our literature search. In one example from Lemons et al., 2020, the random forest classifier was outperformed Naive Bayes and had an accuracy of 97.82% when diagnosing breast cancer. From our results we can see that using both classifiers, Random Forest and Naive Bayes were not able to accurately classify all COI and cytB sequences from AGT proportions alone within the Muridae family. In Random Forest the first classifier generated had an error rate of 0.07, and although negligible we wanted to see if it could be classified more accurately. We decided to increase the number of trees to 500, however, the error rate remained at 0.07%. Next k-mers of length 2 were used for our training dataset however the error rate remained at 0.07%, increasing the number of trees to 500 did not help with accuracy, so we used k-mers of length 3. Using k-mer length of 3 we were able to classify both our training dataset as well as validation dataset accurately with 0 error rate. The error rate of each of the three classifiers can be seen in figure 3 labelled as "random_error, random_error_1 and random_error_2. This is analysis was followed up by Na?ve Bayes prediction algorithm. Naive Bayes followed a similar pattern, where AGT proportions and k-mer of length 2 were not sufficient to accurately differentiate all COI and cytB, however using k-mer of length 3 was able to differentiate both our training and validation dataset accurately. The error rate of each of these classifiers can also be seen in figure three labelled as Bayes_error, Bayes_error_1 and Bayes_error_2. Despite what is found in the literature, our results show that Random Forest and Naive Bayes performed somewhat equally as both required additional information i.e k-mer length of 3 to accurately classify all genes. However, it is noteworthy that random forest classifiers had a lower error rate for AGT and k-mer length of 2 for training sets when compared with Bayes. 

#In terms of biases, our dataset had a large amount of data from the species from Mus spertus, 2nd largest from Apodemus draco and 3rd largest from Apodemus sylvaticus. This may impact our classifier and it may be more accurate for those species however, the degree to which it is impacted was not tested here. In the future it will be beneficial to explore statistical tests to see if the observed differences are significant between the two models. In addition, testing various other classifiers could be beneficial in determining which one works best for gene classification of COI and cytB this can include the regression model. We could also test this classifier on other taxonomic species to see if there is common sequence variation between cytB and COI that is present in other species. In conclusion our results show that Random forest and Naive Bayes perform quite equally when classifying COI and cytB genes within the Muridae family.
